* Starter Page

Hello Thomas Alexgaard, ready to work?

Hey bro, read this:
just write a single page a day, on days you feel like working,
write multiple, its *that* easy.

I understand it is hard to put in the work to something that
feels meaningless, but the truth is, there is not much time left for you to finish
this thing. please, put in the work now, or you will regret it later...
